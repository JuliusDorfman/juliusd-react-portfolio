Welcome to my Portfolio

A Mission Statement to myself.

# Julius D. Portfolio

This Portfolio, as well as my Person, are in a perpetual state of growth. As my career progresses and I have more projects under my belt, I look forward to updating this portfolio. It will simultaneously serve as a method to communicate to my peers and employers my ability to grow, while also providing bookmarks in my progression.
